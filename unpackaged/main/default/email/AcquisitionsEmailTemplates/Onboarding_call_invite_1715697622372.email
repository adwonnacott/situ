<span style="font-family:Archia;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong><span style="color:#4022c0;"><b>Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}}</b></span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:Segoe UI;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="color:#000000;">Thank you for reaching out to explore a potential partnership with Situ and for your patience while I have been working through many applications.<br />
<br />
We are thrilled to have the opportunity to work with many partners and wouldnâ€™t succeed without people like you. It is my job to help get you set up with Situ and help you throughout the onboarding process.<br />
Thank you for completing the Situ Partner Onboarding Form. This has allowed us to start our necessary due diligence checks as part of our commitment to maintaining high service standards for our clients.<br />
<br />
I have reviewed your properties and company information, and I am delighted to say that we would love to partner with you! We are excited to include all your properties in our portfolio and work together to impress our clients.<br />
<br />
Please also have a look through the three attached documents as they will give you more of an understanding of what it is like to be a Situ Supplier, what our client base looks like, and also some top tips on working with us.<br />
<br />
Before we set up your supplier portal login details, I would love to put a call in next week so we can go over the final details and understand the main requirements perfectly. Please let me know when would be suitable.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Looking forward to hearing from you!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many thanks,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
